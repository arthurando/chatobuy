# WhatsApp Message Templates

### What's WhatsApp Message Templates?

To drive high-quality conversations between people and businesses, the WhatsApp Business Platform has a 24-Hour Custom Service Window, after which businesses can initiate the conversation only through **Message Templates**.

1. **User-initiated** - When the user or customer sends the message to the business. The business can respond to the message with a simple message or message template within 24 hours. Once the window has expired, the business can only respond with a message template which will be counted as a Business-initiated conversation.
2. **Business-initiated** - When the business reaches out to the customer outside the 24-hour customer service window, its falls under the Business-initiated conversation. For a business-initiated conversation, a message template is required.

If the business tries to send a message other than a template message outside this 24-Hour window, it will be _failed delivery_.

**A message template could be a text message regarding support, appointment reminders, payment or shipping updates, alerts, etc.** A business can create its own message templates, which is supported at Rampwin as well; however, to send them, they should meet some requirements that are,

* A message template must be approved by WhatsApp before sending. At Rampwin, once created the template, you can send it for approval with a single click.
* A message template is for business-initiated conversation; therefore, a customer must have opted-in to receive messages from your business for that type of conversation.

If your Message Template meets these requirements, you can send them without any further action.

### Types of Message Template
