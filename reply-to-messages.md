### Overview

The Chat module at Chatobuy allows viewing user/customer messages sent or received on different chat platforms. Plus, it enables you to communicate with your customers on different channels and provide top-notch customer service without opening too many platforms or inboxes.

Through Chat, you can respond to queries coming from [WhatsApp](whatsapp-integration.md), [Facebook](facebook-integration.md), [Instagram](broken-reference).

Although upon login to Chatobuy, by default, you'll be on the Chat module interface. But still, to access the Chat module, click the Chat option in the sidebar.

The Chat module has different sections that allow you to efficiently manage and perform several actions on conversations.
