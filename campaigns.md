# Campaigns

The **Campaigns** module at Chatobuy allows you to send manual or scheduled messages or messages to single or multiple contacts. For this, you can use a simple message or a [pre-approved message template](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md) based on the selected [Channel](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md).

To access the Campaigns, head over to the left sidebar and select **Campaigns**.

Currently, there are 2 types of Campaigns available:

* **Campaigns** - Send a one-time message to single or multiple contacts.
* **Drip Campaigns** - Send multiple messages one after another on a timely basis to a single or multiple customers.

Explore the following pages to learn more about these campaign types.

For WhatsApp Channels like [360dialog](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md), [Emma](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md), and [Cloud API](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md), you can send a simple message or List/Button/Options/Product Messages only when it's within the 24-Hour Window of the last message received from the users or customers.

{% hint style="warning" %}
WhatsApp Business Platform has a Customer Service Window (24-hour) in which businesses can send both simple messages and [pre-approved templates](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md). Outside the customer service window, the business would require a message template.
{% endhint %}

The WhatsApp Business Platform works around two different categories of conversation:

1. **User-initiated** - When the user or customer sends the message to the business. The business can respond to the message with a simple message or message template within 24 hours. Once the window has expired, the business can only respond with a message template which will be counted as a **Business-initiated** conversation.
2. **Business-initiated** - When the business reaches out to the customer outside the 24-hour customer service window, its falls under the Business-initiated conversation. For a business-initiated conversation, a message template is required.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To send a campaign message under the Business-initiated conversation type, your business platform must obtain user consent (opt-in) to receive notifications, order updates, event updates, etc. The opt-in could be a simple message or subscription from your website showing the user's consent to receive business-initiated messages from your platform.
