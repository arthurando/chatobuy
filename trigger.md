# Trigger

A trigger in the Automation Workflows allows you to set different conditions to run automated actions.

### Trigger Types

Using triggers, you can activate an automated action(s) based on the conditions fulfilled. It's highly useful to serve your customers in a timely manner and perform different actions when you're away from the platform. Or when you want to handle fewer tasks.

At Chatobuy, you can utilise 4 types of Automation Workflow Triggers:

#### 1. New Outgoing Message

You can use this trigger to set conditions to activate an automated action(s) when you or your teammate send a message to the client/customer/user using [Chat](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md).

#### 2. New Incoming Message

Using this Trigger, you can activate an automated action(s) based on the conditions when you receive a message on the selected [Channel](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md).

#### 3. New Contact Created By Chat

If you or one of your teammates creates a new contact using Chat, then this trigger will run the automated action(s) based on the conditions met.

#### 4. New Facebook Lead Generated

Activate an automated action(s) when a new Facebook lead is generated through the selected integration while creating the automation workflow.

#### 5. When A Tag is Added/Removed

Create an Automation Workflow triggered by the addition or removal of the Tag from the contact's info.

### Conditions & Actions

During [creating an automation workflow](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md), choosing Trigger [**(1)**](trigger.md#1.-new-outgoing-message) or [**(2)**](trigger.md#2.-new-incoming-message) will further open multiple **Trigger Conditions**.

Each Trigger has a different set of conditions. Once these conditions are fulfilled, the automated Actions run.
