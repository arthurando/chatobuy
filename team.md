# Team

### Overview

Team setting allows you to create user accounts for your employers at Rampwin. You can provide them with complete control or limited based on their position. Using their account, your team members can perform different tasks on assigned channels based on their [Department](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md) and [User Role & Permission](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md).

This streamlines the process of managing [Channels](https://github.com/rampwin/rampwin-gitbook-docs/blob/main/broken-reference/README.md) connections to the different chat platforms. Enabling you and your team to respond to users/customers in a timely manner and improve user-client relationships for the Business.

To access Team settings, go to **Settings** â†’ then select the **Team** tab.
