# Facebook Leads

### What is Facebook Leads?

Facebook developed lead advertisements to help marketers produce leads more efficiently by avoiding the difficulties sometimes involved with filling out forms.

Facebook lead advertising allows customers to access your offers without leaving the Facebook app. And obtain the information they need with a few easy taps rather than sending them to a landing page consisting of a form they need to fill out.

Lead advertising offers consumers a quick and simple option to request information from companies they are interested in, which benefits advertisers by increasing click-through rates and generating more high-quality leads at a lower cost.
