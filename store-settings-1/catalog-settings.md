# Catalog Settings

### Authorisation

Using the Catalog Settings of a WhatsApp Channel, you can provide users or customers with product list available on the Facebook Store and enable them to purchase the products directly from WhatsApp chat.

In order to do so, you have to access the Catalog List, and the first step to do that is by authorising the Channel from Facebook. So, for that, click the **AUTHORIZE FACEBOOK** button.

A new mini tab will open; there, you've to log in to your Facebook Account.

Then, click **Continue** for the permission the Chatobuy platform requires.

### Select Business

As soon as you allow the permission, you'd see a new option in the Catalog Settings to Select a Business.

Here, select the Meta Business Account you've used to create the Channel and link it with Chatobuy. Once you select the business, a few more options appear:
