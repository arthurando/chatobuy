Being among the top social media platforms with over 3.065 billion active users, Facebook sends a strong signal to businesses to have a presence there. And with that, business owners must respond to user queries promptly.

However, due to managing queries at a large scale and on other platforms, it's possible they can miss them. Therefore, Chatobuy's Facebook Channel provides a simplified way to communicate with customers over Facebook Messenger without losing track of send and received messages.

To create a Facebook Channel, you'd need:

* A genuine Facebook account.
* And a Facebook Page to connect it with the Chatobuy Facebook Channel.

After creating the page and connecting it with Chatobuy , you can answer queries that users send from Facebook.

If you prefer to watch a video, you can follow the steps in the above video. Otherwise, continue with the following steps to create a Facebook Channel and connect it with the Facebook Page.

### Step 1 - Access Chatobuy Channels

To create a Facebook Chatobuy Channel, you need to open the Channels in Chatobuy . From your Dashboard, head over to the left sidebar and select Channels.

Then, click Configure for Facebook. Or tap the Create Channel button if there are channels already. A popup will appear. In that, select Facebook and click Next.

Upon clicking Next, it will ask you to connect the channel with a Facebook page. For that, click on **CONNECT FACEBOOK PAGE**.

### Step 2 - Login to Facebook

When you'll click the Connect Facebook Page button, a new tab will open asking you to log into Facebook.

Enter the details of the account you want to use for connecting to the Facebook Page. Then, continue with that account.

### Step 3 - Allow Permissions to Chatobuy for the Facebook Page

Once you log in, the tab will display the pages associated with the account. Select the page you want to connect with the Chatobuy Facebook Channel and click _Next_.

After selecting the page, it will ask you what permissions you want to give to the Chatobuy channel.

Simply check **YES** to all the options, and then click _Done_. Once you do that, it will take a few seconds to finalise the linking. After the channel is linked, you'd get the following tab with the lining confirmation.

You can click OK to get back to the Chatobuy interface. The Chatobuy interface will show you the page title, which you can change if you like, then click _Finish_ to complete the channel creation.

Once you do that, you'll get your Chatobuy Facebook Channel like the following.
